                        <p>
                            Filipinos have always been fond of rice cakes or kakanin since the dawn of time. No birthday party, family reunion, or simple get-together would be complete without at least one type of kakanin on the table. Traditions have taught us that a kakanin’s sticky consistency serves as a symbol for a family to remain intact and stick together through thick and thin. So the next time you’re in a Filipino household that’s hosting a party, stop wondering why there’s a colorful-looking rice cake on the table. Just give it a try and be addicted forever!

                        <p>
                            Everybody loves desserts, right? I mean, who wouldn’t? Whether we’re talking about cakes, candies, ice cream, or chocolate, everyone always has a certain sweet craving. As for us Filipinos, we have always known an endless list of tasty and irresistible desserts such as the classic ones like Banana Cue, Halo-Halo, Turon, Mais Con Yelo, and many more. But as a child growing up, there was always this one dessert that we absolutely can’t resist especially when they’re offered at schools by our schoolmates.

                        <p>
                            There’s a famous tradition in the Philippines that dates back all the way to the Spanish Era where Catholics buy Filipino delights like Puto Bumbong or Bibingkang Bigas after they’ve attended the Misa de Gallo or Simbang Gabi. These two desserts have already been the comfort food of Filipinos during the Christmas seasons especially since they’re found within the vicinity of churches and chapels.

                        <p>
                            There are so many Filipino dishes that are guaranteed to make you go for extra rice. There are the ultimate appetizers such as the Bicol Express, Sizzling Sisig, Lechon, Sinigang na Baboy, Laing, Bopis, and many more. But nothing quite compares to one of our all-time favorite ihaw-ihaw specialties, the classic Pork Barbecue. The sweet and savory taste of this dish along with its tender pork meat is simply irresistible. The temptation becomes even harder to resist when it comes with a dipping sauce of vinegar and chilies. Ah, trust me. When this happens, prepare yourself to order multiple cups of extra rice!
