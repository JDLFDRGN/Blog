                                The main draw of Vigan City are its well-preserved Bahay na Bato structures located at the Meztizo District, its historical core. Currently, there are 187 listed ancestral houses in town. Besides this, it also boasts of beautiful colonial churches, a plaza that comes alive with a fountain show at night, a free-roaming zoo and numerous historical museums.

                                The delicious aroma of freshly grilled pork barbecue wafted throughout the resort. That’s our dinner, being cooked by the Blu Serenity Villa butler. Twilight was at hand. I was taking photos as the sky glowed electric. My wife and kid was at the pool, enjoying its warm spring waters. After almost two years, we’re finally on a staycation.

                                Blu Serenity Villa is located just past the busy Pansol area where numerous hot spring resorts have mushroomed in the past decade. But this is no ordinary Pansol resort, they pride themselves in being a premium and exclusive resort in Los Baños.

                                Guimaras is an island province located in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines. It is sandwiched by the province of Iloilo and Negros Occidental. The island is known for its fine, white sand beaches and its sweet mangoes—which is renowned worldwide. Tourist and backpackers flock the island especially during summer for its crystalline waters and a few historical sites.

                                Most travelers usually consider Guimaras as a day-tour destination forming the usual side-trip from Iloilo City, but with this travel guide, I’ll let you in on a little secret, the province has a lot more to offer more than its usual tourist spots and frequented beaches. Check out the 2-day and 3-day itineraries I’ve prepared for those wanting a more intensive Guimaras tour.
